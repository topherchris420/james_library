# James Library: RAG AI Agent Team

James Library is a research-focused platform for **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) AI agents**.

The system is designed around a **team meeting style workflow** where multiple agents converse with each other to analyze topics, compare sources, and build shared conclusions.

## What this project does

- Gives AI agents access to a memory of research papers and indexed knowledge.
- Uses retrieval to ground agent responses in available papers and references.
- Allows agents to access the internet for up-to-date context when needed.
- Supports multi-agent discussion where agents collaborate like a meeting team.

## Core idea

Instead of a single assistant response, James Library enables coordinated agent conversations that combine:

1. **Long-term paper memory** (research corpus knowledge),
2. **Live internet access** (current information), and
3. **Collaborative dialogue** (team-style reasoning).

This makes it easier to produce research-oriented outputs that are both context-rich and grounded in sources.
