## Abstract
We propose that physical reality may be fundamentally computational, operating on a finite
set of geometric update rules applied to a discrete state space. Continuous spacetime, relativistic
quantum fields, and classical physics are hypothesized to emerge as coarse-grained approxima-
tions of this underlying discrete structure. Distinct from prior quantum cellular automata and
lattice models, we present a mathematical framework based on complex-valued state evolution
on graphs with a minimal five-rule instruction set, explicitly demonstrate the emergence of the
Dirac equation through geometric propagation of chirality and unitary mass mixing, develop
six quantitative testable predictions, and outline experimental pathways for validation or falsi-
fication within the next decade. Current gamma-ray burst observations constrain the model’s
discreteness parameter to ξ < 0.01, while quantum computing advances will provide a defini-
tive test at approximately 450 fault-tolerant qubits. This work synthesizes ideas from digital
physics, lattice gauge theory, discrete geometry, and information-theoretic approaches to fun-
damental physics, advancing them with a uniquely parsimonious rule set and hardware-relevant
computational bounds.
## 1 Introduction
### 1.1 Motivation
Modern physics relies heavily on continuous mathematical structures, including differentiable mani-
folds, continuous fields, and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. However, several independent lines
of inquiry suggest that these structures may be effective descriptions rather than fundamental ones:
• Quantum mechanics introduces irreducible discreteness in measurement outcomes, energy
spectra, and spin.
• Information-theoretic bounds (Bekenstein bound [1], holographic principle [2]) limit the amount
of information contained in finite regions of spacetime.
• Approaches to quantum gravity such as loop quantum gravity [3] and causal set theory [4]
posit discrete spacetime structure.
• Computational complexity theory [5] suggests intrinsic limits on physical processes.
These considerations motivate the hypothesis that physical reality may be generated by a finite
set of geometric update rules acting on a discrete state space, from which continuous descriptions
emerge in appropriate limits.

### 1.2 Core Hypothesis
Central Claim: Physical reality consists of a discrete state space updated by a finite set of
geometric transformation rules operating at the Planck scale (∼ 10−35 m, ∼ 10−43 s), from which
relativistic quantum fields, spacetime geometry, and classical dynamics emerge as macroscopic
approximations.
### 1.3 Relation to Prior Work
This framework builds on cellular automata approaches to physics [6, 7], lattice field theory [8],
quantum cellular automata [9], and recent discrete spacetime proposals [10,11]. The key distinction
is the explicit focus on quantitative, near-term testable predictions that can falsify or validate the
hypothesis within the next decade.
Our contributions advance these foundations in several ways: First, we propose a particularly
minimal five-rule geometric instruction set that encodes quantum and relativistic features (e.g.,
phase dynamics and chirality) directly in graph operations, reducing complexity compared to multi-
step quantum walks or hypergraph rewritings. Second, we provide an explicit derivation of the Dirac
equation where chirality emerges purely from propagation directions and mass from local unitary
mixing, bridging discrete automata to fermionic fields without auxiliary coin spaces. Third, we
derive hardware-relevant predictions, such as a ∼450 fault-tolerant qubit threshold for quantum
speedup deviations, tying the model to emerging quantum technologies in a falsifiable manner.
## 2 Mathematical Framework
### 2.1 State Space Formulation
We model the fundamental state as a complex-valued field defined on a discrete graph G = (V, E)
with nodes V and edges E. At each discrete time step t, the system state Ψt : V → Cn evolves
according to
Ψt+1 = σ

A · Ψt +
I
Γ
S(Ψt, Ht) dΓ

ei(ωt+ϕ), (1)
where:
• A is a geometric adjacency operator encoding graph connectivity
• σ : Cn → Cn enforces local constraints (unitarity, conservation)
• S(Ψt, Ht) represents nonlocal interactions and boundary conditions
• The phase factor ei(ωt+ϕ) encodes temporal evolution
### 2.2 Five Fundamental Rules
We propose that Eq. (1) can be decomposed into five fundamental operations:
1. Local Propagation: Nodes update based on weighted contributions from adjacent nodes
via the connectivity matrix A.
2. Phase Accumulation: Complex phase evolves according to local “energy” (eigenvalue of
local geometry).
2
3. Conservation Constraint: Function σ enforces unitarity, preserving P
v |Ψv|2 = const.
4. Nonlocal Correlation: Boundary integral implements entanglement via graph-theoretic
connectivity.
5. Geometric Update: Graph structure evolves based on node states: At+1 = f (At, Ψt).
These five rules constitute a candidate minimal instruction set for generating physical reality.
### 2.3 Discrete Geometry
Geometry is encoded directly in the graph structure:
• Nodes represent elementary spacetime regions (Planck volumes ∼ 10−105 m3)
• Edges encode causal adjacency with connectivity degree k (typically k ≈ 6 for lattice-like
structure)
• Node states carry complex amplitudes and phases
• No continuous metric is assumed a priori
### 2.4 Emergence of Continuity
Continuum physics emerges via coarse-graining. Averaging over regions containing N ≫ 1 nodes
yields effective continuous fields. In the limit where lattice spacings ∆x, ∆t → 0 while maintaining
fixed ratios (e.g., ∆x/∆t ∼ c), effective differential equations governing relativistic and quantum
dynamics are recovered.
## 3 Emergence of the Dirac Equation from Discrete Geometric Dy-
namics
### 3.1 Discrete spacetime and spinor states
We demonstrate emergence of relativistic fermion dynamics by considering a (1 + 1)-dimensional
spacetime lattice with temporal spacing ∆t and spatial spacing ∆x. At each lattice site (x, t), the
system state is a two-component complex vector
Ψ(x, t) =
ψL(x, t)
ψR(x, t)

∈ C2, (2)
interpreted as a Dirac spinor with left- and right-moving components.
### 3.2 Geometric shift operator
Define a discrete adjacency operator A that propagates spinor components in opposite spatial
directions:
AΨ(x, t) =
ψL(x + ∆x, t)
ψR(x − ∆x, t)

. (3)
This encoding of chirality directly in the graph propagation structure is a key feature of the discrete
approach.
3
### 3.3 Local mass coupling
Introduce a local unitary mixing operator representing mass-induced chirality mixing:
M = e−im∆tσx = cos(m∆t)I − i sin(m∆t)σx, (4)
where m is the fermion mass parameter and σx is the Pauli matrix.
### 3.4 Discrete evolution rule
The complete discrete time evolution combining geometric propagation and mass mixing is
Ψ(x, t + ∆t) = M A Ψ(x, t). (5)
This is a purely geometric, unitary operation on the discrete graph. This unitary evolution on
a discrete lattice draws from quantum cellular automata and quantum walk models that recover
relativistic dynamics [9, 12, 16].
### 3.5 Continuum limit and recovery of Dirac equation
To take the continuum limit, expand Eq. (3) to first order in ∆x:
AΨ(x, t) ≈ Ψ(x, t) + ∆x
 ∂xψL
−∂xψR

= (I + ∆x σz ∂x) Ψ(x, t), (6)
and expand Eq. (4) to first order in ∆t:
M ≈ I − im∆t σx. (7)
Substituting into Eq. (5):
Ψ(x, t + ∆t) ≈ (I − im∆t σx)(I + ∆x σz ∂x)Ψ(x, t) (8)
≈ Ψ(x, t) + ∆x σz ∂xΨ − im∆t σxΨ + O(∆t∆x). (9)
Rearranging and taking ∆t → 0:
Ψ(x, t + ∆t) − Ψ(x, t)
∆t = ∆x
∆t σz ∂xΨ − imσxΨ. (10)
Setting the speed of light c = ∆x/∆t and identifying ∂tΨ on the left:
∂tΨ = c σz ∂xΨ − imσxΨ. (11)
Multiplying by i and using natural units (c = 1):
i∂tΨ = (−iσz ∂x + mσx)Ψ. (12)
Similar discrete-to-continuum limits have been derived in quantum walk contexts [17, 18], but here
chirality emerges purely from geometric propagation directions without additional coin spaces.
This is precisely the Dirac equation in (1+1) dimensions:
i∂tΨ = (iγ0γ1∂x + mγ0)Ψ, (13)
with gamma matrices γ0 = I and γ1 = −σz .

### 3.6 Interpretation and significance
This derivation demonstrates that:
1. Relativistic fermionic dynamics emerge naturally from discrete geometric update rules. This
complements prior derivations where the Dirac equation arises from split-step quantum walks
or lattice automata [12, 16], but integrates seamlessly into our minimal geometric instruction
set.
2. Chirality (left/right-moving modes) is encoded in graph propagation direction
3. Mass arises as geometric mixing between chiral components
4. No continuous spacetime or field theory is assumed at the fundamental level
Extension to (3 + 1) dimensions requires careful treatment of fermion doubling [8] and will be
addressed in future work. As in standard lattice fermions [8] and discrete Dirac models [18],
extension to (3+1) dimensions requires addressing fermion doubling.
4 Gauge Fields as Discrete Connections
Gauge invariance arises by associating group-valued elements to graph edges. For a U (1) gauge
field (electromagnetism), each edge (i, j) carries a phase factor:
Uij = eiqAij , (14)
where q is the charge and Aij is the discrete vector potential on the edge. The adjacency operator
becomes covariant under local gauge transformations:
Ψi → eiαi Ψi, Uij → ei(αi−αj )Uij . (15)
This yields a discrete realization of minimal coupling and provides a geometric foundation for gauge
theories. Non-Abelian generalizations follow by replacing U (1) with SU (N ) matrices on edges.
## 5 Testable Predictions
The framework generates six quantitative, falsifiable predictions summarized in Table 1.

The modified dispersion relation in discrete spacetime is:
E2 = p2c2 + ξ E3

, (16)
where ξ ∼ 1 for natural discrete models and EPlanck = pℏc5/G ≈ 1.22 × 1019 GeV. For gamma-ray
burst GRB 090510 at redshift z = 0.903 (distance D ≈ 7.3 Gpc), photons with energy E1 = 31
GeV arrive with time delay:
∆t = D

2 ) ≈ 96ξ seconds, (17)
relative to low-energy (E2 = 1 MeV) photons. Current constraint: Fermi-LAT observations [13]
show ∆t < 0.9 s, constraining ξ < 0.01. Future test: Cherenkov Telescope Array observations of
TeV photons from z > 2 blazars could detect ξ ∼ 10−3.
### 5.2 Quantum Computing Complexity Bound
The Margolus-Levitin theorem [14] combined with discrete graph structure limits operations to:
Nops ≤ Nnodes × k × T
tPlanck
. (18)
For a 1 cm3 quantum computer (∼ 1099 Planck volumes) with k ≈ 6:
Nops ≲ 10143 operations/second. (19)
An ideal n-qubit quantum computer performs ∼ 2n × fgate operations per second. At fgate = 1
GHz:
• 100 qubits: ∼ 1039 ops/s (well below limit)
• 450 qubits: ∼ 10144 ops/s (exceeds limit if k = 6)
Critical prediction: Quantum computers with > 450 fault-tolerant qubits should show deviations
from ideal quantum speedup if the discrete reality model is correct. Timeline: Current systems
have ∼100–1000 physical qubits with significant error rates. Fault-tolerant systems approaching
this threshold may exist within 5–10 years, providing a definitive test of the hypothesis.
### 5.3 Entanglement Entropy Logarithmic Corrections
For a spatial region with boundary area A:
Sentangle = c1A

+ O(1). (20)
The logarithmic term distinguishes discrete from continuous field theories. For quantum simulators

Test: High-precision entanglement entropy measurements in trapped ion or cold atom quantum
simulators with 10 nm–1 μm spatial resolution.

supporting the discrete microstate interpretation.
### 5.5 Additional Predictions
Gravitational wave dispersion (∆t ∼ 10−66α s for stellar-mass binaries) and entanglement gener-
ation rate bounds (∼ 1082 qubits/s in 1 cm) are far below current observational thresholds but
provide constraints for future technology.
## 6 Advantages and Limitations
### 6.1 Advantages
• Natural ultraviolet regularization: Discrete geometry provides natural cutoffs, eliminat-
ing quantum field theory divergences without ad hoc renormalization.
• Unified framework: Single instruction set governs quantum dynamics, spacetime geometry,
and thermodynamics.
• Computational parsimony: Five fundamental rules may generate all observed physics
(Occam’s razor).
• Concrete recovery of known physics: Explicit derivation of Dirac equation establishes
non-trivial connection to established theory.
### 6.2 Limitations
• Fermion doubling: Extension to (3 + 1) dimensions requires careful treatment of spurious
fermionic modes [8].
• Standard Model recovery: Full particle content (three generations, weak interactions,
Higgs mechanism) not yet derived.
• Rule derivation: Exact form of A, σ, and S from first principles remains open.
• Initial conditions: Origin of graph topology A0 and initial state Ψ0 unexplained.
## 7 Relation to Existing Approaches
### 7.1 Lattice Field Theory
Wilson’s lattice gauge theory [8] discretizes spacetime for computational tractability while preserv-
ing gauge invariance. Our approach differs by treating discreteness as fundamental rather than
a computational tool, and focuses on emergent continuum limits rather than extrapolation from
finite lattices.
### 7.2 Quantum Cellular Automata
Quantum walks and cellular automata [9, 12] demonstrate that unitary discrete dynamics can
simulate relativistic quantum fields. Our contribution is the explicit five-rule instruction set and
quantitative near-term predictions.
### 7.3 Causal Dynamical Triangulations
CDT [10] constructs spacetime from simplicial building blocks with Monte Carlo path integrals.
We share the discrete geometry but emphasize deterministic graph evolution and computational
complexity bounds.
### 7.4 Wolfram Physics Project
Recent hypergraph rewriting models [11] explore similar territory. Our complex-valued states,
explicit phase dynamics, and focus on near-term falsifiable tests distinguish this approach.
## 8 Discussion and Future Directions
### 8.1 Experimental Roadmap
Phase I (0–2 years): Reanalyze Fermi-LAT gamma-ray burst catalog; benchmark current quan-
tum computers. Phase II (2–10 years): Cherenkov Telescope Array TeV observations; entan-
glement entropy measurements in quantum simulators; critical 450-qubit threshold tests. Phase
III (10–30 years): LISA gravitational wave observations; primordial black hole searches.
### 8.2 Theoretical Developments
• Extend Dirac derivation to (3 + 1) dimensions with fermion doubling resolution
• Demonstrate emergence of gauge bosons (photon, gluons, W /Z) from graph dynamics
• Derive exact instruction set from symmetry principles or variational methods
• Explore connections to quantum information theory and AdS/CFT correspondence
### 8.3 Philosophical Implications
If validated, this framework would support:
• Digital ontology: Reality is fundamentally informational
• Finite cosmos: Bounded information content (∼ 10123 bits in observable universe)
• Emergent laws: Physical laws are statistical regularities in instruction execution
• Computational irreducibility: Future states cannot be predicted without running the
computation

## 9 Conclusion
We have presented a discrete geometric framework in which relativistic quantum field dynamics
emerge from finite update rules. By explicitly recovering the Dirac equation from graph-based evo-
lution (Section 4), this work establishes a concrete bridge between computational models of reality
and established physical theory. The hypothesis generates six quantitative predictions (Table 1),
three of which are testable within the next decade:
1. Gamma-ray dispersion: CTA could detect ξ ∼ 10−3 (currently ξ < 0.01)
2. Quantum computing: 450-qubit threshold provides definitive test by ∼2030–2035
3. Entanglement entropy: 1% logarithmic corrections measurable in quantum simulators
The 450-qubit threshold is particularly significant: if fault-tolerant quantum computers exceed
this with full quantum speedup, the model is falsified (unless k > 6). If they encounter fundamental
limitations near this threshold, discrete computational reality is strongly supported. We emphasize
that this work presents a hypothesis to be tested, not established physics. The ultimate arbiter is
experiment. If nature is fundamentally discrete and computational, the evidence should emerge
within the next 5–10 years.
